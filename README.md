Gather Ring Code for TUI

Our project is a bracelet designed to monitor and enhance adolescent social development through capturing play activity during the recess of elementary schools. During recess, the Gather Ring bracelet tracks gestures and interactions among children. To do this, the Gather Ring bracelet utilizes several sensors and output devices. The Gather Ring bracelet encourages positive social interaction among children and enables teachers to have the ability to be more aware of the social dynamics and development by monitoring childrensâ€™ play activity.
